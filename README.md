ProtégéVOWL
===========

Source code of the VOWL plugin for Protégé. 

Note that ProtégéVOWL has some known bugs and does not implement all visual elements defined in the VOWL specification. A more complete implementation of VOWL 2 is provided by the web application [WebVOWL] (https://github.com/VisualDataWeb/WebVOWL)

See http://vowl.visualdataweb.org for more information on ProtégéVOWL and WebVOWL


### Ant Usage

To be able to run the ant build file properly you have to create a local file named 'local.properties' which will be ignored by the VCS. This file must contain at least the line 'protege.home=' followed by the path of Protege.
